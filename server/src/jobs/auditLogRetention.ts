/**
 * auditLogRetention.ts — 365-day retention for audit_logs (issue #539).
 *
 * Deletes audit entries older than AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS in bounded
 * batches. The audit_logs trigger (migration 013) rejects every DELETE unless
 * the transaction has set `airflex.audit_retention = on` AND the row is older
 * than 365 days, so this job is the only code path that can remove entries
 * and it cannot remove anything younger than the retention window.
 *
 * A transaction-scoped advisory lock ensures only one server instance purges
 * at a time when several replicas run the same schedule.
