 * with the event payload via `renderTemplate` / `renderNotification`.
 *
 * Placeholders are expressed as `{name}` tokens and are substituted from the
 * payload passed to `NotificationService.send(...)`. Rendering is strict: a
 * placeholder without a matching payload value throws a
 * `MissingTemplateVariableError` instead of leaking a raw `{name}` token into
 * a message a user will read.
