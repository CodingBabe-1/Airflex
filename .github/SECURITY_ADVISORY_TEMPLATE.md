## Severity (your estimate)

  Maintainers confirm the final severity during triage (within 5 business days).
  The confirmed severity sets the resolution SLA.
-->

- [ ] Critical (CVSS 9.0–10.0) — direct loss of user funds or mass account takeover · resolution SLA 7 days
- [ ] High     (CVSS 7.0–8.9)  — authenticated access to another user's data · resolution SLA 30 days
- [ ] Medium   (CVSS 4.0–6.9)  — security control bypass without immediate fund loss · resolution SLA 60 days
- [ ] Low      (CVSS 0.1–3.9)  — minor information disclosure or defence-in-depth gap · resolution SLA 90 days

## Disclosure Preferences

  agreed in writing.
-->

- [ ] I agree to the coordinated disclosure timeline in SECURITY.md
- [ ] I consent to being credited in the published security advisory
- [ ] I would like to co-ordinate on a public write-up after the fix is deployed
- [ ] I prefer to remain anonymous
