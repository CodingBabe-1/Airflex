# 🗺️ AirFlex Roadmap

This roadmap is the public, issue-driven plan for AirFlex. It maps the work in
the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/issues) to
distinct milestones so contributors can see what the project is building next,
and users can understand what is coming.

- **Status legend:** ✅ shipped · 🚧 in progress · 📋 planned
- **Target dates** are quarter-based and indicative, not commitments.

## Won't Fix (for now)

Deliberately deferred features, with rationale. Revisit these when the
underlying assumption changes.

- **Native mobile apps** — AirFlex targets mobile-first users in Nigeria where
  app-store distribution can be a barrier. The PWA ([#107](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/issues/107))
  delivers an installable, offline-capable experience without store approval or
  platform-specific code. Native apps add significant maintenance cost for
  little user benefit at this stage.
- **GraphQL subscription layer ([#116](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/issues/116))** —
  the SSE endpoint ([#72](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/issues/72)) already
  covers real-time trade updates with far less infrastructure. Revisit only if
  clients demonstrate a concrete need for queryable subscriptions.
- **End-to-end encryption for trade chat ([#122](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/issues/122))** —
  there is no chat feature yet. E2E encryption is only meaningful once
  messaging exists, and premature key-management complexity would slow the
  marketplace MVP.

## Community Requests

Feature ideas are collected and upvoted on the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/arflexx/Airflex/discussions) page.
(Note: discussions must be enabled by the maintainers before the page is
live — until then, please open a feature-request issue instead.) The most
upvoted requests are candidates for the next milestone.
